# Loading / instantiating code

It is recommended to start julia with multiple threads, since many concurrent tasks will be executing. 

```
julia --project --threads=auto
```

```julia
(VehicleSim) pkg> instantiate
(VehicleSim) pkg> add https://github.com/forrestlaine/MeshCat.jl
(VehicleSim) pkg> add https://github.com/forrestlaine/RigidBodyDynamics.jl
```

```julia
julia> using VehicleSim
```

# Running Simulation

```julia
julia> s = server();
[ Info: Server can be connected to at 1.2.3.4 and port 4444
[ Info: Server visualizer can be connected to at 1.2.3.4:8712
```

This will spin up the server / simulation engine. For now, the server will instantiate a single vehicle. 

# Connecting a keyboard client

```julia
julia> using Sockets # to allow ip strings
julia> keyboard_client(ip"1.2.3.4") # ip address specified by @info statement when starting server
[ Info: Client accepted.
[ Info: Client follow-cam can be connected to at 1.2.3.4:8713
[ Info: Press 'q' at any time to terminate vehicle.
```

# Shutting down server
```julia
julia> shutdown!(s)
```

# Development workflow
- Pre-compiling everything takes a while so we want to minimize time spent here
  - Use Revise to let you make code changes without having to reload in the pkg: `using Revise, VehicleSim`
  - the project code is setup with a shutdown_channel that worker threads use to kill themselves when you press `q`. this lets us use Revise since the threads don't keep running making us terminate the entire julia instance and restart it and the precompilation again
